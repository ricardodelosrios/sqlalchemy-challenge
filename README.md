# sqlalchemy-challenge

##Introduction

This project will analyze the climate in Honolulu, Hawaii, considering that a vacation is planned at this destination.

## Folders and files

* It is going to find a**folder** in this project:

   * The folder called `Resources` will find 2 CSV files ans 1 sqlite that were used to complete this challenge. Listed below are the names of the files you will find:

      * [hawaii.sqlite](https://github.com/ricardodelosrios/sqlalchemy-challenge/blob/main/Resources/hawaii.sqlite)
      * [hawaii_measurements.csv](https://github.com/ricardodelosrios/sqlalchemy-challenge/blob/main/Resources/hawaii_measurements.csv)
      * [hawaii_stations.csv](https://github.com/ricardodelosrios/sqlalchemy-challenge/blob/main/Resources/hawaii_stations.csv)
    
  * It will find **2 Files** in this project:
  
    * [climate_starter.ipynb](https://github.com/ricardodelosrios/sqlalchemy-challenge/blob/main/climate_starter.ipynb): In this file are the queries to analyze and explore the Climate Data..
    * [app.py](https://github.com/ricardodelosrios/sqlalchemy-challenge/blob/main/app.py):There is a py file where a Flask API was designed.

## Installation

To install:

SQLite reads and writes directly to ordinary disk files, which can in turn be stored on a computerâ€™s hard drive. This makes it much easier to use to perform tests and share between users. If you do not have SQLite installed, run the following code within your terminal: 

`conda install -c anaconda sqlite`

## Analyze and Explore the Climate Data

It was used the files (`climate_starter.ipynb` and `hawaii.sqlite`) to complete your climate analysis and data exploration.

To complete this part of the exercise, the `SQLAlchemy` module is used, which is part of a Python library that is used to work with relational databases in a more efficient and readable way. As you can see below:

```
import sqlalchemy
from sqlalchemy.ext.automap import automap_base
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, func, inspect

```
Below you will find the explanation of the functions that were used from the sqlalchemy module.

* `automap_base`: This is a part of SQLAlchemy's Object Relational Mapping (ORM) system. It provides a way to automatically map database tables to Python classes.
* `Session`: The Session class is part of SQLAlchemy's ORM system as well. It represents a workspace for your database operations. You create a session when you want to interact with the database, and it keeps track of changes and transactions.
* `create_engine`: This function is used to create a database engine. The engine serves as the foundation for interacting with the database. It establishes a connection to the database and manages database connections and transactions.
* `func`: The func module allows you to use SQL functions in your SQLAlchemy queries. This is especially useful when you need to perform calculations or aggregate data within your queries.
* `inspect`: The inspect module is used to inspect database objects, such as tables, and gather information about them. It can be helpful when you need to dynamically query and analyze the database structure.

If you want to know more about SQLAlchemy you can use the following [documentation](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/).

## Design Your Climate App

You will design a Flask API based on the queries you just developed. To do so, use Flask to create your routes as follows:

1. `/`
   * Start at the homepage.
   * List all the available routes.

2. `/api/v1.0/precipitation`
   *Convert the query results from your precipitation analysis (i.e. retrieve only the last 12 months of data) to a dictionary using date as the key and prcp as the value.
   *Return the JSON representation of your dictionary

3. `/api/v1.0/stations`
   *Return a JSON list of stations from the dataset.

4. `/api/v1.0/tobs`
   * Query the dates and temperature observations of the most-active station for the previous year of data.
   * Return a JSON list of temperature observations for the previous year.
  
5. `/api/v1.0/<start>` and `/api/v1.0/<start>/<end>`
